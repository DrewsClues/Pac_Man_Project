<h1>
  Pac Man Project
</h1>

MITxPro Week 4 project

<h1>
  Description:
</h1>

This is a simple program which creates a Pacman which moves back and forth across the screen. The mouth opens and closes as it moves and the character should change directions once it reaches the edge of the screen. 

<h1>
  Installation:
</h1>

To install download all the files into one folder, make sure the images are all stored together in their own images file. Open the index.html file in a browser and the animation should begin on its own. 

<h1>
  Usage:
<h1>
  These files are a good start to the Pacman game or as a reference for a beginner programmer learning about moving images. 
  </h1>
  
  <h1>
  Roadmap:
  </h1>
  
  In the future I would like to the make the Pacman controllable with the keyboard in both the x and y directions and perhaps create a level or two.
